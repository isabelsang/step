      <h1>Isabel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Isabel and I am excited to be a STEP intern at Google this summer.
         On this page you can learn a little bit more about me.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in New Jersey and am currently working from home in NJ. Jersey gets a 
         pretty bad rap sometimes--people have told me it is the "Armpit of America" or "the ugly 
         stepchild of New York"-- but I love it here.  We have everything you could want in a state:
         a nice beach to relax on, beautiful mountains to go hiking on, NYC (coolest city in the US) 
         within driving distance, and the greatest bagels on the planet.  
      <p>I am very passionate about the superiority of NJ bagels.  You may be skeptical and think that 
         "all bagels taste the same" or that "there's no way that JERSEY of all places makes the best 
         bagels," but let me be the first to tell you that no, not all bagels are created equal and 
         that yes, New Jersey is home to the best bagels.    
      <p>Don't believe me? You simply HAVE to come to New Jersey and try them.  It should be the 
         number one location on your bucket list.
