      <h1>Isabel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Isabel and I am excited to be a STEP intern at Google this summer.
         On this page you can learn a little bit more about me.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in New Jersey and am currently working from home in NJ. Jersey gets a 
         pretty bad rap sometimes &mdash; people have told me it is the "Armpit of America" or "the ugly 
         stepchild of New York" &mdash; but I love it here.  We have everything you could want in a state:
         a nice beach to relax on, beautiful mountains to go hiking on, NYC (coolest city in the US) 
         within driving distance, and the greatest bagels on the planet.</p>  
      <img src="/images/bitmoji-field.JPG" alt="Bitmoji Field Image">
      <p>I am very passionate about the superiority of NJ bagels.  You may be skeptical and think that 
         "all bagels taste the same" or that "there's no way that JERSEY of all places makes the best 
         bagels," but let me be the first to tell you that no, not all bagels are created equal and 
         that yes, New Jersey is home to the best bagels.</p>    
      <img src="/images/bitmoji-mmm.png" alt="Bitmoji Mmmm Image">
      <p>Don't believe me? You simply HAVE to come to New Jersey and try them.  It should be the 
         number one location on your bucket list.</p>

      <h2>Beep Boop Bop</h2>
      <img src="/images/bitmoji-hero.png" alt="Bitmoji Superhero Image">
      <p>When I am not in NJ eating bagels every morning, you can find me at college at Washington University in St. Louis 
         (aka WashU).  There, I spend my days beep boop bopping and working toward my major of Computer Science and Math.  I am
         not 100% sure what I want to do after college but I know it will have something to do with computer science or coding or 
         technology or saving the world... who knows?</p>
      <p>I also have always really loved art.  I used to take art classes in middle and high school, and while I am DEFINITELY not
          the next Picasso, I would love to minor in Design and continue exploring the field after college, even if it is just a hobby.</p>
